PdfMiniTools is a set of small utilities for working with PDF files:
	pdfInfo - displays information on the properties and field content of a PDF file.
	pdfCat - joins two or more PDF files into a single file.
	pdfExtract - extracts pages from a PDF file into a new file.
	pdfSplit - splits a PDF file into two or more files.

Version 4.0 of the .Net framework is required.

Visual C# 2010 Express (with SP1), NUnit 2.5, Warsetup 3.13, and Wix 3.5 were used
to build, and test the project.

The following third party components are used/included:
- CommandLine Parser library (v1.8 stable) - http://commandline.codeplex.com/
- PDF icon from open icon library (LGPL ) - http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/gallery2/?./Icons/apps/acroread.png
- iTextSharp (v4.1.6 - last LGPL version) - http://itextsharp.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/itextsharp/tags/iTextSharp_4_1_6/

iTextSharp 4.1.6 was used instead of a new version because of its less restrictive license - using a newer
version would mean PdfMiniTools could not be integrated into commercial/proprietary applications.
